# errgo

Is a custom error handling package that wraps the
[errx](https://github.com/magicalbanana/errorx.git).

This is a highly opinionated package that adds some benefits to the `errorx`
package. One key feature is that the package's `errgo.Error` can be logged
with [paralog](https://github.com/ParaServices/paralog.git).
